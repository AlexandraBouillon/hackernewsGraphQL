## GraphQL subscriptions?
- afeature that allows a server to send data to its clients when a specific event happens.
- Subscriptions are usually implemented with WebSockets.
- In that setup, the server maintains a steady connection to its subscribed client.
- This also breaks the “Request-Response-Cycle” that were used for all previous interactions with the API.


## Setting up PubSub ##
-[] index.js
```
const { PubSub } = require('apollo-server')

const pubsub = new PubSub()
```
