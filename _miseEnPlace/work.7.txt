## Filtering, Pagination & Sorting     ##
Pagination
Pagination is a tricky topic in API design. On a high-level, there are two major approaches for tackling it:

Limit-Offset: Request a specific chunk of the list by providing the indices of the items to be retrieved (in fact, youâ€™re mostly providing the start index (offset) as well as a count of items to be retrieved (limit)).
Cursor-based: This pagination model is a bit more advanced. Every element in the list is associated with a unique ID (the cursor). Clients paginating through the list then provide the cursor of the starting element as well as a count of items to be retrieved.

-[] add the filter string to the feed query in your application schema:

.../hackernews-node/src/schema.graphql
type Query {
  info: String!
  feed(filter: String): [Link!]!
}
